# ZEN POT - Recipe app

This is a school project that
[Kristbjörg](https://github.com/Kristbjorgosk)
, [Kolbrún](https://github.com/kollaaj)
& [Hulda](https://github.com/Huldas96) worked on together. The project description was to create a **React app** with **2 API** keys and we were free to use **React framework** for styling.

Kristbjörg og Kolbrún did the coding and Hulda did the UI design. We all did UX research together.

# The API used

We decided to make a mobile and tablet version of a recipe app. We used an API from [Spoonacular](https://spoonacular.com/food-api/docs#Diets) to **search for recipes and filter them out by selecting ingredients, max ready time and diets**.

The second API we used is from [FUN Generators API](https://fungenerators.com/api/facts/), we used that to display a **Random food fact** of the day on the frontpage.

# Styling package & Library

We used **npm packages** for the google fonts and [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com) for some components. Other styling was done in a variable inside each component.

In the **src** file we have a **Component file** and a **Pages file**.

# Connecting the pages together

To connect the pages together we used **React Router**.

### This is our first React app we deploy and we had 7 days to do the coding. There are alot of things we wanted to implement but did not manage because of time, maybe we will add it some day in the future.

We are very proud of our little recipe app, [here is the live demo version](https://zenpot.netlify.app)
